# CS797 Project 3 - API Connectivity
## Introduction
This project is based off of the sample MAUI calculator app with added functionality and UI.

## Functionality
A local API is used to generate math exercises, and then the MAUI app will connect to the API through a HTTP client and get the exercises from the database.

These exercises are displayed on their own flyout page, with three choices for answers, and a counter for overall score.
